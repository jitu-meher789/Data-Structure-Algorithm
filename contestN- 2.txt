You have been taken prisoner by Alexander the Great. 
He offers you your freedom if you can solve his string challenge.

In a string s of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive
 groups of the same character. For example, a string like s = "cfxxxxzyy" has the 
groups "c", "f", "xxxx", "z", and "yy".

A group is identified by an interval [start, end], where start and end denote 
the start and end indices (inclusive and 0 based) of the group. In the above example, 
"xxxx" has the interval [3,6].

A group is considered large if it has 3 or more characters. 
Return the intervals of every large group sorted in increasing order by start index.

Input Format
The input contains the string S

Constraints
1 <= s.length() <= 1000
The string s contains lowercase English letters only.

Output Format
Each line of the output contains 
two integers i.e the start and end index of a group.

Sample Input
cbbxxxxzzzd
Sample Output
3 6
7 9
Explanation
"xxxx" and “zzz” are the only large groups 
present. “bb” and “d” are not considered large 
because the elements don't appear at least thrice in a row.

A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), 
and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents 
a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

Given an integer N which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, 
return all possible times the watch could represent. You may return the answer in any order.

The hour must not contain a leading zero.

Input Format
An integer, N.

Constraints
0 <= N <= 10

Output Format
Space-separated strings showing the time.

Sample Input

existing ticket with the swapped one.
You are given a number representing the Lottery Ticket. What would be Vivek’s Ticket number, 
if he could use the option given by The Sunday Lottery based on the tip?
Note: He may or may not use the option provided.

Input Format
First line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. 
Next T lines contain an integer, denoting the Lottery Number L.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 104
1 <= L <= 108

Output Format
Print the Ticket Number with highest win probability for each test case on a new line.

Sample Input
2
3845
7731
Sample Output
8345
7731
Explanation
3845, he could swap 3 and 8 to get 8345
7731, no swap would provide a ticket with higher probability.

A string s is said to be Beautiful String if s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.

Given a string s , Print True if s is a beautiful string .

Input Format
Single line consists of a string s

Constraints
1 <= s.length <= 105

Output Format
Print "True" or "False"

Sample Input
raceacar
Sample Output
True
Explanation
we can transform string s ="raceacar" into a palindromic string after removing either 'a'(at index 4) or 'e'(at index 3)
"racecar" or "racacar" both are palindromic strings , Hence the given string s is a Beautiful string
